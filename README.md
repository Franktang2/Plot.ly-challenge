## Background

Built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. Three objects were created:

1) Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
2) Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
3) Table with the information about the subject that is being shown in the charts mentioned before.

All graphs are dynamic as you can choose the subject using the dropdown menu.
